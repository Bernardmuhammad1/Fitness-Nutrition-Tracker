# Fitness-Nutrition-Tracker
A simple fitness &amp; nutrition tracker to help users build consistent habits.
The goal of FitTrack is to help individuals stay consistent with their fitness goals by tracking their daily exercise and nutrition in a lightweight, easy-to-use interface. Many fitness apps available today are either too complex, filled with unnecessary features, or hidden behind a paywall. FitTrack will focus only on the essentials, allowing users to log workouts, record daily meals, and view basic progress statistics. This application is ideal for people who are just starting their fitness journey and don’t want to be overwhelmed by a full-featured app. It’s designed for users who need accountability but prefer simplicity, for example, busy students or professionals, individuals who exercise at home, or those just looking to build healthier habits without overcomplicating things.
